## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v20.x or later recommended)
-   npm (comes with Node.js)
-   Firebase CLI (install with `npm install -g firebase-tools`)
-   A Google Cloud Project with the "Generative Language API" (or "Vertex AI API") enabled and billing active.
-   A Firebase project.

### Installation & Setup (Local Development)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lxmwaniky/foodmood
    cd foodmood
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `npm ci` for a cleaner install based on `package-lock.json`)

3.  **Set up Local Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key. This file is for **local development only** and should **not** be committed to Git (ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file).

4.  **Run the Development Servers:**
    You need to run two development servers concurrently for the full application experience:
    *   **Next.js App (Frontend):**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will typically start the frontend on `http://localhost:9002`.

    *   **Genkit AI Flows (Backend):**
        Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:watch
        ```
        (or `npm run genkit:dev` for a single run without watching for changes)
        This starts the Genkit development server, making your AI flows available.

5.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the application.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

-   `npm run dev`: Runs the Next.js app in development mode with Turbopack.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the Next.js app for production.
-   `npm run start`: Starts the production Next.js server (after building).
-   `npm run lint`: Runs the ESLint linter to check for code style issues.
-   `npm run typecheck`: Runs the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.
-   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server.
